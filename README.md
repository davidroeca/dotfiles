#### David's configuration settings
This repo is meant to store and track my configuration settings for a number of programs. It currently only tracks my configuration settings for vim.
The .vimrc file requires vundle, which can be installed with the command:  
> $ git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
